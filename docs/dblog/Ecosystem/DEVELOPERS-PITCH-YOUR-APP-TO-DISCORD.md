We’re looking for one of the coolest, most supportive Discord app ideas within these categories: 

Apps for Artists: Creative artists are one of the biggest communities on Discord. They’re home to digital painters, sketch artists, and physical crafters who knit or share macrame patterns. Add a little color and creativity to Discord servers around the globe by creating an app that brings artists together to share skills, participate in challenges, or just enjoy a bit of doodling together.
IRL Impact: Discord is great for connecting like-minded friends and digital communities across the globe; it also helps real schools, club meetups, and neighborhoods stay organized and connected. We’re looking for a new app experience designed to help these types of Discord servers make a real impact in their IRL communities.
Mini-Games: Insane news scoop here — gamers use Discord. Millions of people talk on Discord while playing games on console, PC, and mobile, but many more play games right within Discord itself, whether solo or with others. They spelunk through text-based dungeons, run virtual food stands, tend to their game’s farms, or answer trivia. App-based games on Discord keep the fun online any time of the day.
Learning: Have you always wanted to learn a new language, practice a skill, or collect obscure fun facts to drop at a family gathering or win that trivia game? We have too… and who doesn’t love feeling like their chill time was also a bit productive. Studies show that learning is much faster, easier, and more fun when you do it alongside friends. Support your educational endeavors by creating an app for Discord that’ll support your accountabilibuddies and share goals to strive for, and throw a leaderboard in there for a bit of friendly competition (one that you’ll win).
Wildcard: If you’ve been inspired by an idea that doesn’t fit perfectly with the other categories, then this is the place for you. There are no rules, guidelines, or restrictions for a wildcard pitch! If you have an interesting area that’s a little niche, give it a go and submit your idea anyway — you might discover there are others who’ll be super grateful for your new app! After all, finding friends with like-minded interests is what Discord is all about! 
The top ideas and pitches will receive funding directly from our Ecosystem Fund: Each category winner will receive $5,000 in funding. Winners are eligible for an additional $10,000 if their project is completed within 60 days of receiving their initial funding, bringing the total prize pool across all five categories to $75,000. Judges include Discord's VP of Engineering Prachi Gupta, Netflix's Brand Manager Colin Parajon, and many more rad individuals
